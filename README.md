A tool for real time plagiarism detection on sites like Chegg and CourseHero

## Motivation 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most schools are planning to move to remote learning for the foreseeable future, 
which brings its own set of challenges. A very prominent challenge is cutting down on incidences of plagiarism 
and other forms of honor code violation. Hence, we would like to develop an application that allows the teaching 
staff to monitor commonly known websites that host homework/test solutions such as Chegg & Coursehero real-time 
for posts asking for such solutions. This will relieve the staff from the burden of having to manually check for 
these posts themselves, particularly in those schools that are unable to allocate sufficient resources to tackle 
this increase in the number of plagiarism incidents.
